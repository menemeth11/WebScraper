# Web Scraper

## General info
Simple program to extract some data from a web page (up to 16 subpages).
I made this application to understand how web scraping works.

## Technologies
- c#
- HtmlAgilityPack

## Setup
- Program -> line 34 -> provide the location of the template file (template.txt)
- Program -> line 42 -> provide a location where the .txt file will be save

Program works only with this page: https://wiadomosci.onet.pl/

## Features
- you can choose desired keywords from articles  
- output saved as a .txt file with the date of file creation as it's name
